## Project Goal
- To implement *Ghost of Tsushima*-style grass using Unreal Engine 5
- To demonstrate the capabilities of the Niagara Data Channel (NDC) and PCG combination in a real-time GPU simulation of a large number of instances.

---

## üß† Project Summary

- Based on the *Ghost of Tsushima* GDC presentation
- Fully real-time grass generation and motion system using hierarchical PCG + Niagara + physics
- Enhanced physical realism with the **Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA)**
- Implemented unique improvements, including:
  - Fixed-length grass via **Quadratic B√©zier Curve**
  - Physics-based dynamic motion using ABA
  - Physical constraints for joint angle displacements
  - Grass blade twist based on angular displacement

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### üå± Grass Modeling & Optimization
- **Hierarchical PCG grid** for runtime spawning and cleanup
- **Quadratic B√©zier Curve** used for grass blades
  - Fixed length maintained, unlike the cubic version used in *Ghost of Tsushima*

![Bezier Curve Grass Example](./resources/bezier_curve_example.jpg "Bezier Curve Grass Example")  
**Bezier Curve Grass Example:** P0 and P1 B√©zier points function as rotational joints.

### üí® Wind & Motion Simulation
- Wind simulated via noise functions
- Skeleton-based articulation:
  - P‚ÇÄ: Ball joint (3 DOF)
  - P‚ÇÅ: Hinge joint (1 DOF)
- Elastic recovery toward initial pose, with randomized stiffness
- Forces:
  - Wind force (adjustable via UI)
  - Air friction (adjustable via UI), acting as a damping force
  - Restoration force from grass joints

### ‚öôÔ∏è Physics System
- Referenced but improved upon [SIGGRAPH paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2856400.2876008)
- Discarded inaccurate or unstable parts of the original paper
- Replaced with:
  - **Forward Dynamics via Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA)**
  - Maximum angular displacement  limit constraints
  - Ground collision handling

## üîå Niagara Data Channel + PCG Integration

- Niagara emitters dynamically spawned based on the PCG grid
- ABA-based motion data (angular velocity, acceleration, displacement) calculated in Niagara
- Emitters and particles cleaned up based on camera position
- Custom workflow:
  - PCG writes to the **Niagara Data Channel**
  - Niagara interprets and visualizes in real time
  - Niagara emitter instances kill particles or themselves based on camera position and direction

## ü¶æ Motion Comparison

### Motion Under Strong Wind Force

**Before Maximum Angular Displacement Limit and Collision**

![Strong Wind Motion Without Limit](./resources/no_limit.gif "Strong Wind Motion Without Limit")

[üîó Start at wind force 40 scene](https://youtu.be/sHjHLRHukEs?si=raVWfqdE0HeZyLcM&t=68)

**After Maximum Angular Displacement  Limit and Collision**

![Strong Wind Motion](./resources/after_limit.gif "Strong Wind Motion")  
[üîó Start at wind force 40 scene](https://youtu.be/5h7HZT5iuCI?si=dYmNk5WoUefEqJj9&t=36)

Without angular displacement limits and collision:
1. Grass can store unlimited restoration force as it can rotate and twist infinitely
   - (In reality, grass blades would be just broken already)
2. Resulting motion becomes inconsistent with wind behavior

### Reference Study Motion

Results after modifying the reference paper, including:
- Fixing calculation errors
- Removing inconsistent algorithms and replacing with:
  - Angle limit constraints
  - Ground collision handling
- Fixed grass length

The grass tends to align into straight lines under strong wind.

## üß™ Procedural Variation with Voronoi

![Voronoi Diagram Example](./resources/voronoi_example.jpg "An example of Voronoi Diagram")  
**Voronoi Diagram Example:** Locations sharing the same nearest point belong to the same region.

PCG-generated Voronoi regions used to assign:
- Grass length
- Grass width
- Stiffness
- Initial direction
- Color noise
- Population density

Smooth transitions between regions using linear interpolation for:
- Population density
- Grass length

![Grass Region Example](./resources/grass_voronoi_regions.jpg "Grass Region Example")  
**Grass Voronoi Region Example:** Box meshes mark Voronoi points. Three regions with different colors, shapes, and population densities.

![Grass Region Interpolation Example](./resources/voronoi_region_linear_intp.jpg "Grass Region Interpolation Example")  
**Region Linear Interpolation Example:** Gradual change in grass length from region center (white box) to boundary.

## ü§î Challenges & Solutions

### Finding a Physically Accurate Algorithm

I noticed the reference paper ignored several physical factors, but I didn‚Äôt know how to accurately calculate them.

#### Solution

1. Asked an AI (Claude)
2. It gave unreliable, hallucinated answers
3. Asked what the common term for this problem is and which field I should study
4. It gave the keyword "Multi-body dynamics"
5. Googled it and found it was exactly the field I needed
6. Studied multi-body dynamics basics and tutorials for 4 days
7. Gained enough knowledge to implement ABA

### PCG with Niagara Particle Cleanup

Unlike static mesh spawners, PCG cannot directly clean up Niagara particles.  
Niagara emitters must handle cleanup to prevent duplicated grass.

#### Solutions

1. Kill particles based on distance between the camera and the PCG grid the particle belongs to
2. Kill particles based on a comparison between their spawn time and the last time PCG sent data to the emitter
  - Requires NDC extent to match PCG grid size
  - May fail if the character moves extremely fast or teleports
  - Details in my [custom tutorial video](https://youtu.be/C1LmzQKNnzI)

Since writing to NDC from PCG was a new feature without documentation, I figured it out through trial and error.

So, I made a tutorial video to help others:

- Add grass particle blow effects
- Improve grass models with more varied shapes
- Improve optimization (possibly using Nanite)
- Improve shadows
