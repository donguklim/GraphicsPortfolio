## üß† Project Summary

- Based on the *Ghost of Tsushima* GDC presentation.
- Fully real-time grass generation and motion system using hierarchical PCG + Niagara + Physics.
- Enhanced physical realism with **Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA)**.
- Implemented unique improvements, including:
    - Fixed-length grass via **Quadratic B√©zier Curve**
    - Physics based Dynamics motion with ABA
    - Physical constraints for joint angles
    - Added grass blade twist based on angular displacement

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### üå± Grass Modeling & Optimization
- **Hierarchical PCG grid** for runtime spawn/cleanup.
- **Quadratic B√©zier Curve** used for grass blades.
    - Fixed length maintained, unlike cubic version used in *Ghost of Tsushima*.

![Bezier Curve Grass Example](./resources/bezier_curve_example.jpg "Bezier Curve Grass Example")

**Bezier Curve Grass Example:** P0, P1 Bezier points works as rotational joints.

### üí® Wind & Motion Simulation
- Wind simulated via noise functions.
- Skeleton-based articulation:
    - P‚ÇÄ: Ball joint (3 DOF)
    - P‚ÇÅ: Hinge joint (1 DOF)
- Elastic recovery toward initial pose, with randomized stiffness.
- Forces
  - Wind force (adjustable by UI)
  - Air friction force (adjustable by UI), works as damping force
  - Resotration force from grass joints

### ‚öôÔ∏è Physics System
- Referenced but improved upon [SIGGRAPH paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2856400.2876008)
- Discarded inaccurate or unstable parts of the original paper.
- Replaced with:
    - **Forward Dynamics via Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA)**
    - Angle limit constraints
    - Ground collision handling

## üîå Niagara Data Channel + PCG Integration

- Niagara emitters dynamically spawned based on PCG grid.
- ABA-based motion data (angular velocity, acceleration, displacement) calculated in Niagara.
- Emitters and particles cleaned up based on camera position.
- Custom workflow:
    - PCG writes to **Niagara Data Channel**
    - Niagara interprets & visualizes in real-time
    - Niagara emitters instances kill particles or kill itself based on camera position and direction.

> üìò *Created a custom tutorial for using PCG with Niagara Data Channel Interface, since no existing guides were available.*

Motion result of the Siggraph paper after
- fixing calculation error
- removing inconsistent additional procedures

## üß™ Procedural Variation with Voronoi
![Voronoi Diagram Example](./resources/voronoi_example.jpg "An example of Voronoi Diagram")

**Voronoi Diagram Example:** Locations sharing the same nearest points belong to the same region.

- PCG-generated Voronoi regions used to assign:
    - Grass length
    - Grass width
    - Stiffness
    - Initial direction
    - Color noise
    - population density
- Smooth transition between regions via linear interpolation on some characters.
  - population density
  - Grass length

![Grass Region Example](./resources/grass_voronoi_regions.jpg "Grass Region Example")
**Grass Voronoi Region Example:** The box meshes are located at Voronoi points. Three regions showing different colors, shapes and populations.

![Grass Region Interpolation Example](./resources/voronoi_region_linear_intp.jpg "Grass Region Interpolation Example")
**Region Linear Interpolation Example:** Gradual change of grass length from the region center(White box) to the region boundary can be observed.
